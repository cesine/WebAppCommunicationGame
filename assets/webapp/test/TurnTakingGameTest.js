/*
The turn taking game can start when it has two players

Player: child is the person who asks for the pieces

Player: admin is the player who gives the pieces and who has a data entry canvas for taking notes

The game has a gameboard (which keeps track of where all the pieces are)

If the admin player drags the piece from the bin into their tray, it is sent ot the child player

The current layout of the child player's screen is sent to the admin player's screen

The admin player can exit the game at any time (they can also pause by simply neither player playing.)

The game can be resumed or replayed automatically. 

The game is saved in a list of "previous games"

The game records the eye gaze of the child player.

The game also records the touches of the child player as part of the game history.

The game can be played wiht a wooden shape game as a user interface, or as a go-fish or battleship user interface. 
(if it is played as go fish then both players are child and neither one gest to see the other's screen)
